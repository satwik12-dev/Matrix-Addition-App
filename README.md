# Matrix Arithmetic Operations Console and GUI Based APP 🧮

## 📌 Description

**Matrix Addition App** is a simple Java console as well as GUI based application that performs arithmetic operations on two matrices i.e Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication. The user is prompted to enter the dimensions and elements of two matrices, and the application computes and displays the resulting matrix.

This project is ideal for beginners learning:
- Java & Swing 
- 1D & 2D arrays
- Loops and user input
- Input validation

### ▶️ Sample Session

```
Choose the operations You want to perform from the given list:
1: 1-Dimension Array Addition
2: 2-Dimension Array Addition
3: 1-Dimension Array Subtraction
4: 2-Dimension Array Subtraction
5: 1-Dimension Array Multiplication
6: 2-Dimension Array Multiplication
0: Exit.....
Enter the operation you want to perform from their S.NO. i.e 1,2,3,4,5,6,0:
1
Enter the size of array 1:
3
Enter the size of array 2:
3
Enter the element of array 1:
1 2 3
Enter the element of array 2:
4 5 6
Your both 1D Array after addition is:
5 7 9 
Addition Completed for 1D Array.......

Enter the operation you want to perform from their S.NO. i.e 1,2,3,4,5,6,0:
